                      People are different. We want to strengthen your
                      relationships through shared experiences you care about.
                      So, we build systems that try to understand who and what
                      you and others care about, and use that information to
                      help you create, find, join, and share experiences that
                      matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,
                      features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in,
                      and offering ways for you to experience xbyters.com, based
                      on things you and others do on and off xbyters.com. The

                Currently, various browsers — such as Internet Explorer,
                Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option
                that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a
                signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's
                browser DNT preference setting. xbyters.com does not currently
                commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to
                the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry
                standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology
                companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of
                interpreting user intent. xbyters.com takes privacy and
                meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to
                monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the
                implementation of a standard.
