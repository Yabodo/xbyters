                      People are different. We want to strengthen your
                      relationships through shared experiences you care about.
                      So, we build systems that try to understand who and what
                      you and others care about, and use that information to
                      help you create, find, join, and share experiences that
                      matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,
                      features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in,
                      and offering ways for you to experience xbyters.com, based
                      on things you and others do on and off xbyters.com. The
                      Services allow you to create, publish and share short-form
